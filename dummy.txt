Darwin's Theory of Evolution is the widely held notion that all life is related and has descended from a common ancestor, the birds and the bananas, the fishes and the flowers are all related. Darwin's general theory presumes the development of life from nonlife and stresses a purely naturalistic (undirected) "descent with modification". That is, complex creatures evolve from more simplistic ancestors naturally over time. In a nutshell, as random genetic mutations occur within an organism's genetic code, the beneficial mutations are preserved because they aid survival, a process known as "natural selection". These beneficial mutations are passed on to the next generation.
